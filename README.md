# Mission to Mars

## Overview 
I have been tasked with creating a web app for Robin, who would like to admire images of Mars and its hemispheres. In order to do this I utilized BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database and then use a web application to display the data, and finally alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

## Resources

  *  A distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use

  * Flask is a widely adopted Python framework for building web applications.
  * PyMongo is the official MongoDB Driver for Python.
* **HTML5lib** - A Python library required to run scraping code successfully. Used to parse HTML in Python
